# A Yathzee game built in React

A Yathzee game built in React. You have three rolls and can save/lock the dice by clicking them. After the three rolls are up you are prompted to click one of the rule lines for points. Your final five dice are compared against the rule and you are given the points if it match up. Reload the page to restart the game. Good luck!
